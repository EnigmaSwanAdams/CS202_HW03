                      The Ghost in the Red Shirt

                            by B. M. Bower


The proper way to begin this story would be to assure the reader,
first of all, that I have never believed in ghosts; that is the way
ghost-stories usually begin, I think. Also, I should say that what I
am about to relate is perfectly true—but I won’t begin it like that.
As a matter of fact, I don’t care much whether you believe me or not,
and I always did believe in ghosts—at least, I always hoped they were
truer than Santa Claus, and that some day I should see one.

Aunt Jane—but I don’t want to begin with Aunt Jane either: she always
did begin everything in my life, ever since I can remember, and she
sha’n’t begin this story. I don’t mean her even to know I wrote
it—she’d only say I’m crazy, and I’m not.

This is the way it all happened, and, mind, I don’t care whether you
believe it or not. It _happened_, and your belief or disbelief won’t
alter that one important fact. And he was the dearest old ghost—but
wait till I start at the beginning, as I should have done before.
